# Python Calculator
To help me learn python, I built a terminal calculator that allows you to do simple maths calculations like adding, subtracting, dividing and multiplying.

## Features
- Add, subtract, divide & multiply.

## Languages/Tools used:
- Python
- Atom

## Installation
First download project from Github by going over to the green 'code' button and downloading the zip file. Once downloaded, extract the folder.

Then head over to [the python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version of python.

Once that's done, you can check that it was successful by opening your terminal:

### Mac:
Keyboard shortcut is "command + spacebar" then search "terminal".

```
python3 --version
```


### Windows:
Keyboard shortcut is "ctrl + alt + w"

```
python --version
```

### Linux:
Keyboard shortcut is "ctrl + alt + t"

```
python --version
```
